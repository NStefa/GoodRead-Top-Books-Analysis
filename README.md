## Goodreads Top 100 Books Analysis (1980–2023)

This project is all about exploring the Goodreads Top 100 Books per Year published between 1980 and 2023. I wanted to see what kind of patterns show up when you look at books across four decades — things like:

- Are standalone books more common than in-series books?
- Which authors or series show up the most?
- Do genres or ratings shift over time?
- Is there any seasonality in when books are published?

### What I did

- Cleaned up the dataset (fixed dates, page numbers, removed duplicates).
- Added a few useful features, like decades and whether a book belongs to a series or not.
- Looked at trends in ratings, genres, number of pages, and engagement.
- Created some simple visualizations to answer questions around series vs. standalones, recurring authors, and seasonality.

### Tools I used

- Python (***pandas, numpy***) for data prep.
- ***Matplotlib*** for charts.
- Jupyter Notebook to keep everything organized and visual.

### Files in this repo

- `goodreads\_top100\_from1980to2023\_final.csv` – the dataset I worked with.
- `book\_analysis.ipynb` – my notebook with all the analysis.

### What’s next

There’s still a lot left to dig into. I’d like to spend more time writing up clear conclusions from the analysis, and it could be fun to experiment with an interactive dashboard to make the results easier to explore.
